 Geo Location is the identification or estimation of the real-world geographic location of an object, such as any hotel,  restaurant , local  shops etc.. In its  simplest form geolocation involves the local street shops and is closely related to the use of a positioning system,  but its usefulness is enhanced by the use of these coordinates to determine a meaningful location, such as a street address.

Every place on earth can be identified by two simple numbers: the longitude and latitude.
Longitude is a geographic coordinate  that specifies the east-west position of a point on the Earth's surface. It is an angular measurement, usually expressed in degrees.
Latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the north south position of a point on the Earth's surface. Latitude is an angle (defined below) which ranges from 0° at the equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east–west as circles parallel to the equator.
